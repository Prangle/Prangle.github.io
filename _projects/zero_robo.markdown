description: I founded and led a team to compete in the Zero Robotics programming competition! Our task was to navigate a satellite through a field of debris and rescue a stranded satellite. We were selected for an alliance with two teams from Romania, and we placed 2nd in our division finals. Click here to watch our rescue code in action onboard the ISS!
